            <h1>Steps</h1>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Sauté the Eggplant:</strong> While pasta is boiling (it took 10 minutes for me) heat 2 tablespoons
                     of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic, and sauté for about 5 minutes,
                      until onions are translucent and fragrant. Add the chopped eggplant, salt and pepper, and cook for another 10 minutes until
                     the eggplants is soft enough that the wooden spoon or spatula can slice right through it</li>
                <li><strong>Cook the Vegan Meat:</strong> Add in the vegan beefless crumbles/veggie chunks/crumbled veggie burgers and stir to combine.
                     Cook for about 3 minutes. Depending on yours, you may need to add a bit more salt at this point. Taste and add accordingly. Reduce heat to medium low, add in all the tomato sauces and
                     stir to combine, for about 3 minutes. Taste and add salt accordingly. Remove from heat and set aside.</li>
                <li><strong>Begin Building the Lasagna:</strong> In a 13” x 9” pan, add 1/2 cup of “meat” marinara sauce mixture on the bottom and spread 
                    with a spatula to create an even bottom layer. 
                    Cover the bottom with about 4 lasagna noodles lengthwise, overlapping a bit. This will be your first layer.</li>
                <li><strong>Bake:</strong> Cover the pan with foil and bake in the oven for 30 minutes covered. Then broil for about 3-5 minutes of low broil
                     to brown the cheese on top. Top with basil, and allow to set up on the counter for about 10 minutes before cutting into slices. Cut into 9 or 12 even slices. Serve and enjoy!
