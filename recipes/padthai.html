            <h1>Steps</h1>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare the noodles:</strong> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat, then add the 
                    noodles and cook them according to the package instructions. Drain and return the noodles to the pot. 

                </li>
                <li><strong>Cook the tofu:</strong> While the noodles boil, heat 2 tablespoons of oil in a large skillet set 
                    over medium heat. Add the tofu and cook until it’s browned on all sides. Transfer the tofu to a plate. 

                </li>
                <li><strong>Make the sauce:</strong> Stir together the tamarind paste, tamari or soy sauce, sugar, rice vinegar, and chili garlic
                     sauce in a small bowl or liquid measuring cup. 

                </li>
                <li><strong>Cook the Pad Thai:</strong> Heat the remaining tablespoon oil in the skillet, this time over medium heat. Add the peppers
                     and mushrooms and cook until softened, about 5 minutes, stirring often. Return the tofu to the skillet, then add the noodles and sauce.
                      Stir to combine and cook for 1 to 2 minutes, or until everything heated through and evenly coated in the sauce. 

                </li>
                <li><strong>Finish:</strong> Stir in the bean sprouts and lime juice, then turn off the heat. Serve with peanuts and cilantro.

                </li>
            </ol>
